A parsing error occurred: An output parsing error occurred. In order to pass this error back to the agent and have it try again, pass handle_parsing_errors=True to the AgentExecutor. This is the error: Parsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: You are an agent designed to answer questions about sets of documents. You have access to tools for interacting with the documents, and the inputs to the tools are questions. Sometimes, you will be asked to provide sources for your questions, in which case you should use the appropriate tool to do so. If the question does not seem relevant to any of the tools provided, just return "I don't know" as the answer.
